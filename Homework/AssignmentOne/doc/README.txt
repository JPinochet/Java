AssignmentOne:

Once the program runs a menu will appear immediately as follows.
What would you like to do?
a) Print all items
b) Add an item
c) Delete an item
d) Search for an item by type and then subcategory
e) Exit program

Should you select e, the program will exit immediately and do nothing.

If you choose the function to print all the items (a), it will prompt you to input either m for movies or g for games
and display all items in the selected category.

In the event b is selected, it will prompt the user weather they would like to add a movie or a game and then request
the appropriate information for the item in question, but only after checking if it's a valid ID or else the program
will cause an error and exit.

If the user wishes to delete an item from the database, then the user would select c and proceed to request to delete
either a movie or a game, upon entering their selection they will be prompted for the id, and then the program will 
delete that item from the database and the user will return to the menu.
Should the user need to know if an item is entered into their database, they should select d for the search option, 
which will once again prompt the user to search for a movie or game, and then request the ID to be searched for.

Once the menu pops up again and the user wishes to exit the program, they simply need to select e.

I hope this program is to your satisfaction. 
Thank you for your time,
